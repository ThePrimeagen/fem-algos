## We did it!
We are done with lists...

<br/>
<br/>

but in a sense... the next data structure is a list with multiple paths...

<br/>
<br/>

The best part is that our knowledge of recursion will get very solidified over
the next couple sections most traversals are recursive...

### All programming eventually leads to trees
I swear, every complex project I have ever worked on ends up being a tree
exercise.  I hope you are ready!  This is where we really have to put all of
our skills together.

### Where are trees?
* Your filesystem is a tree
* The dom is a tree
* Trees are massively important in compilers.  You have probably mininumly
  heard the term Abstract Syntax Tree.
* and there is more...

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Lets do a quick whiteboard example to solidify it.
Just in case none of those examples stuck with you

<br/>

### Terminology
root - the most parent node. The First. Adam. <br/>
height - The longest path from the root to the most child node <br/>
binary tree - a tree in which has at most 2 children, at least 0 children <br/>
general tree - a tree with 0 or more children <br/>
binary search tree - a tree in which has a specific ordering to the nodes and at most 2 children <br/>
leaves - a node without children <br/>
balanced - A tree is _perfectly_ balanced when any node's left and right children have the same height.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Traversals
there are different ways in which you can visit the nodes of a tree.
* pre order
* in order
* post order

<br/>

### Lets code for a second
Lets create all three different traversals!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### These types of traversals are known as
Depth First Search.  But that isn't the only traversal there is!

Breadth first search.

### Lets implement
* bfs

<br/>
<br/>

### PRACTICE PROBLEM!
This use to be a very common problem in the hiring world.

* Comparing two binary trees to see if they are equal in both shape and
  structure.

Lets first whiteboard it

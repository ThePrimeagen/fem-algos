## Welcome
The Last Algorithms Class You Need

<br/>
<br/>

## The Last course you will ever need?
That seems a bit much, huh?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## These are the algorithms I have ran into
My goal is foundation.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Why should I care about algorithms?
* Isn't asking algorithms old fashion for interviews?
* I don't actually use any of them on the job right?

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Let me ask you this
What data structure is used here (answer in your head)?

```typescript
const a = [];
```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


### Remember, Arrays are the simpliest Data Structure

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Time and Space Complexity
* there will be no proofs
* there will be graphs though

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Why TypeScript?
* I do not like typescript for data structures, but I chose it to make this
  class the most beginner friendly class.

#### You can get intro'd into rust via

### Who Am I?
* I am CEO of TheStartup

### Ready to get started?
Yes trying to have the smallest intro ever on FEM.

<br/>
<br/>

### One last note.
When I was at university, this 2 day course will approximate my 2nd semestar
class.  There is only one problem.  My class met 3 times a week, for one hour,
for 15 weeks.  That is 45 hours of class time.  On top of that, every 1 hour of
class, I was expected to study for 4 hours.  On top of that, I had a 1 hour
lab, which was expected to spend 5 hours preparing for.

<br/>
<br/>

So that means this class is meant to represent what would typically take 3 * 45
+ 15 * 5 hours worth of work, or 225 hours.  But I have less than 16, including
lunch breaks.

<br/>
<br/>

So to get the most out of this class, spend some time doing this yourself.
There are great books and resources you can use.

<br/>
<br/>

### My biggest piece of advice is this is the entrence, not the destination.
Of the four books I have bought on data structures and algorithms, here are my
recommended 2.
<br/>
(yes they are amazon affiliate links) <br/>
(but i have read both, multiple times, and bought the academic one 3 times) <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

[The Introduction to Algorithms](https://amzn.to/3bYmBMu) <br/>
This one is pretty girthy, but its definitely the best there is.

<br/>
<br/>

[For Programmers Who Don't Know How To DataStructure And Would Like To Do Other Things Well Too](https://amzn.to/3Qp9KlB) <br/>
This one is way more beginner friendly, and will help reinforce most things we
learn today and other things as well.  Its a bit lacking though in its
completeness.
